# Predicting House Prices In Ames, Iowa
The [Ames Housing data set was introduced in 2011 by Dean De Cock](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) at Truman State University. It contains 2930 observations of 80 variables, divided more or less evenly among ordinal, nominal, continuous and discrete. With data from 2006-2010, De Cock intended to provide a contemporary alternative to the Boston Housing data set, which was compiled in the 70's.

In this notebook, I will clean and explore the data, then briefly optimize a handful of regression models for predicting 'Sale Price'.
